# Vintage Telephones Rational 

My website explores vintage telephones from the Powerhouse Collection. It aspires to display information from Powerhouse through a customised web design inspired by my website prototype and mood boards, utilising semantic HTML and CSS within Visual Studio Code. 

In my prototype, my overall theme was inspired by following similar colour schemes of natural materials like wood and leather, which were commonly used in vintage designs. For this project, I am still following the same principles; however, I've taken into consideration how brown, white, and black tones are perceived. I believe brown is not only meant to convey its visual appearance but also to give the audience a warm and inviting display, as the tones darken, it becomes more mature and sophisticated. I wanted to communicate a sense of timelessness through all the rust, chipping and dents, these vintage telephones are viewed beautiful, setting them apart from mass-produced modern items today. Which I wanted to elevate via a minimalistic layout framework of image-content-image. As well as to allow quick and easy to understand exploration.  

My goal was to replicate my prototype as best as possible with basic knowlege of HTML and CSS I learned in a short time frame. 

My process was following basic HTML 5 structure from modules, starting with elements html, head, and body then tags h1, p, img, a and div. Experimenting and practising on Glitch seeing how they function in creating simple web pages. 

Once I was comfortable with HTML I began my journey with CSS to replicate my prototype. Like HTML I followed basic CSS Syntax from the modules such as colour, font, font size and text alignment. After went to images and page layouts with padding and flex boxes. 

With my extra features such as CTA button symbols and a carousel by following guides and examples from the W3C. Such as:

* [Symbol (copy right)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_symbols.asp)
* [Image styling (text on top of image)](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp)
* [Buttons (CTA)](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp)
* [Styling links (hover, active, link, visited)](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp)

And modified my carousel which needs Java changing it to be beginner friendly with an image slider instead using only HTML and CSS found on youtube by [Skillthrive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McPdzhLRzCg).

The challenges I faced was remaking my website on a new software to organise and structure my code for easy readability. In my first code on Glitch, I did not know how to organise my CSS resulting in syntaxes all over the place and not knowing what syntax and classes to use making it confusing and stressful. Therefore I remade my whole website in VSC using CTRL / to add comments in HTML and CSS. Another difficulty was finding the right syntax especially layouts revisiting W3C and as a beginner, it is extremely difficult to remember what the properties are, how to use them, and how they function. Lastly, was using the wrong syntax which made one mistake, causing the whole layout to be distorted and needed to work from the beginning and wasting time. 

However, I enjoyed the process of making a whole website from scratch understanding the problem and finding the right solution. Creating a website that I never imagined myself completing or learning.
